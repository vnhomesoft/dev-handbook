# Outline for a CI/CD architecture document

Here's a comprehensive outline for an infrastructure architecture document detailing a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, SonarQube, AWS Fargate, and other related components:

---

## ðŸ“˜ CI/CD Infrastructure Architecture Document

### 1. **Executive Summary**
- Purpose of the document
- Scope of the CI/CD pipeline
- Key technologies used (AWS CodePipeline, SonarQube, Fargate, etc.)
- Business and technical goals

---

### 2. **Architecture Overview**
- High-level diagram of the CI/CD pipeline
- Summary of stages: Source â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Deploy â†’ Monitor
- Integration points between services

---

### 3. **Components and Services**
#### 3.1 Source Control
- Git repository (e.g., GitHub, CodeCommit)
- Branching strategy (main, dev, feature branches)

#### 3.2 CI/CD Orchestration
- AWS CodePipeline
  - Pipeline stages
  - Trigger mechanisms (e.g., push events, PR merges)

#### 3.3 Build and Test
- AWS CodeBuild
  - Buildspec configuration
  - Environment setup
- SonarQube
  - Static code analysis
  - Quality gates and thresholds
  - Integration with CodeBuild

#### 3.4 Containerization
- Docker
  - Dockerfile structure
  - Multi-stage builds
- Amazon ECR
  - Image storage and versioning

#### 3.5 Deployment
- AWS Fargate (via ECS)
  - Task definitions
  - Service configuration
  - Load balancing (via ALB)
- Blue/Green or Rolling deployment strategy

#### 3.6 Monitoring and Logging
- Amazon CloudWatch
  - Logs, metrics, alarms
- AWS X-Ray (optional)
- SonarQube reports
- Deployment dashboards

---

### 4. **Security Considerations**
- IAM roles and policies
- Secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store)
- Network isolation (VPC, subnets, security groups)
- Artifact integrity and scanning

---

### 5. **Scalability and Availability**
- Auto-scaling for Fargate tasks
- High availability setup for SonarQube (if self-hosted)
- Pipeline concurrency and parallelism

---

### 6. **Cost Optimization**
- On-demand vs. reserved Fargate tasks
- Build time efficiency
- Storage lifecycle policies (ECR, S3)

---

### 7. **Disaster Recovery and Rollback**
- Backup strategy for SonarQube and ECR
- Rollback mechanisms in CodePipeline
- Versioning and tagging practices

---

### 8. **Operational Workflow**
- Developer workflow (commit â†’ PR â†’ merge â†’ deploy)
- QA and staging environments
- Manual approvals and gates
- Notifications (SNS, Slack, email)

---

### 9. **Infrastructure as Code**
- Terraform or AWS CloudFormation templates
- CI/CD pipeline as code
- Version control for infrastructure

---

### 10. **Appendices**
- Glossary of terms
- Sample buildspec.yml and Dockerfile
- IAM policy examples
- Troubleshooting guide
