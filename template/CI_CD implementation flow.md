- Explain secrets management strategy
- Define network architecture (VPC, subnets, security groups)

### ðŸ”¹ 1.5 Operational & Maintenance Details
- Describe developer workflow
- Include rollback and disaster recovery strategies
- Add monitoring and alerting setup

### ðŸ”¹ 1.6 Infrastructure as Code
- Include Terraform or CloudFormation snippets
